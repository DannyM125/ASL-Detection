# ASL-Detection
The objective of this project is to detect and recognize American Sign Language (ASL) signs in real-time using a webcam. This is accomplished using computer vision and machine learning techniques, with the help libraries such as cv2, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.

The object training process is carried out using the Teachable Machine image model maker, which is a web-based tool for creating custom machine learning models. The model is trained to identify ASL signs by using a dataset of images representing the signs A, B, and C.

During runtime, the webcam is used to capture live video data, which is processed by the OpenCV library. OpenCV provides the necessary tools to preprocess and analyze the video data, enabling the detection and recognition of ASL signs in real-time. Once a sign is detected, the corresponding letter is output to the screen.

It is worth noting that the current version of the project only recognizes the ASL signs A, B, and C, but other signs can be easily added to the model to improve its versatility.
